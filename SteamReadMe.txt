[h1]Cargo and Merc Hotkeys[/h1]


Adds hotkeys to the ship's cargo and mercenary buttons.

The keys can be configured and default to C for cargo and X for mercenaries.
The default for mercenaries is X due to the game using M for Map.

[h1]Configuration[/h1]

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at [i]%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph\QM_CargoMercHotkeys\config.json[/i].

The list of valid keyboard keys can be found  at the bottom of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
Beware that numbers 0-9 are Alpha0 - Alpha9.  Most of the other keys are as expected such as X for X.
Use "None" to not bind the key.
