# Cargo and Merc Hotkeys

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

Adds hotkeys to the ship's cargo and mercenary buttons.

The keys can be configured and default to C for cargo and X for mercenaries.
The default for mercenaries is X due to the game using M for Map.

# Configuration

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at `%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph\QM_CargoMercHotkeys\config.json`.

|Name|Default|Description|
|--|--|--|
|CargoKey|C|Opens the cargo screen|
|MercenariesKey|X|Opens the mercenaries screen|

## Key List
The list of valid keyboard keys can be found  at the bottom of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
Beware that numbers 0-9 are Alpha0 - Alpha9.  Most of the other keys are as expected such as X for X.
Use "None" to not bind the key.
